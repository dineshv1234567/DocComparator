  "readme": "textract\n========\n\nA text extraction node module.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/textract.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/textract/)\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/textract.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/textract/)\n\n## Currently Extracts...\n\n* HTML, HTM\n* ATOM, RSS\n* Markdown\n* XML, XSL\n* PDF\n* DOC, DOCX\n* ODT, OTT (experimental, feedback needed!)\n* RTF\n* XLS, XLSX, XLSB, XLSM, XLTX\n* CSV\n* ODS, OTS\n* PPTX, POTX\n* ODP, OTP\n* ODG, OTG\n* PNG, JPG, GIF\n* DXF\n* `application/javascript`\n* All `text/*` mime-types.\n\nIn almost all cases above, what textract cares about is the mime type.  So `.html` and `.htm`, both possessing the same mime type, will be extracted.  Other extensions that share mime types with those above should also extract successfully. For example, `application/vnd.ms-excel` is the mime type for `.xls`, but also for 5 other file types.\n\n_Does textract not extract from files of the type you need?_  Add an issue or submit a pull request. It many cases textract is already capable, it is just not paying attention to the mime type you may be interested in.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install textract\n```\n\n## Extraction Requirements\n\nNote, if any of the requirements below are missing, textract will run and extract all files for types it is capable.  Not having these items installed does not prevent you from using textract, it just prevents you from extracting those specific files.\n\n* `PDF` extraction requires `pdftotext` be installed, [link](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html)\n* `DOC` extraction requires `antiword` be installed, [link](http://www.winfield.demon.nl/), unless on OSX in which case textutil (installed by default) is used.\n* `RTF` extraction requires `unrtf` be installed, [link](https://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/), unless on OSX in which case textutil (installed by default) is used.\n* `PNG`, `JPG` and `GIF` require `tesseract` to be available, [link](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).  Images need to be pretty clear, high DPI and made almost entirely of just text for `tesseract` to be able to accurately extract the text.\n* `DXF` extraction requires `drawingtotext` be available, [link](https://github.com/davidworkman9/drawingtotext)\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration can be passed into textract.  The following configuration options are available\n\n* `preserveLineBreaks`: When using the command line this is set to `true` to preserve stdout readability. When using the library via node this is set to `false`. Pass this in as `true` and textract will not strip any line breaks.\n* `exec`: Some extractors (dxf) use node's `exec` functionality. This setting allows for providing [config to `exec` execution](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback). One reason you might want to provide this config is if you are dealing with very large files. You might want to increase the `exec` `maxBuffer` setting.\n* `[ext].exec`: Each extractor can take specific exec config. Keep in mind many extractors are responsible for extracting multiple types, so, for instance, the `odt` extractor is what you would configure for `odt` and `odg`/`odt` etc.  Check [the extractors](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/tree/master/lib/extractors) to see which you want to specifically configure. At the bottom of each is a list of `types` for which the extractor is responsible.\n* `tesseract.lang`: A pass-through to tesseract allowing for setting of language for extraction. ex: `{ tesseract: { lang:\"chi_sim\" } }`\n* `tesseract.cmd`: `tesseract.lang` allows a quick means to provide the most popular tesseract option, but if you need to configure more options, you can simply pass `cmd`. `cmd` is the string that matches the command-line options you want to pass to tesseract. For instance, to provide language and `psm`, you would pass `{ tesseract: { cmd:\"-l chi_sim -psm 10\" } }`\n* `pdftotextOptions`: This is a proxy options object to the library textract uses for pdf extraction: [pdf-text-extract](https://github.com/nisaacson/pdf-text-extract). IMPORTANT: textract modifies the pdf-text-extract `layout` default so that, instead of `layout: layout`, it uses `layout:raw`. It is not suggested you modify this without understanding what trouble that might get you in. See [this GH issue](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/75) for why textract overrides that library's default.\n* `typeOverride`: Used with `fromUrl`, if set, rather than using the `content-type` from the URL request, will use the provided `typeOverride`.\n\nTo use this configuration at the command line, prefix each open with a `--`.\n\nEx: `textract image.png --tesseract.lang=deu`\n\n## Usage\n\n### Commmand Line\n\nIf textract is installed gloablly, via `npm install -g textract`, then the following command will write the extracted text to the console for a file on the file system.\n\n```\n$ textract pathToFile\n```\n\n#### Flags\n\nConfiguration flags can be passed into textract via the command line.\n\n```\ntextract pathToFile --preserveLineBreaks false\n```\n\nParameters like `exec.maxBuffer` can be passed as you'd expect.\n\n```\ntextract pathToFile --exec.maxBuffer 500000\n```\n\nAnd multiple flags can be used together.\n\n```\ntextract pathToFile --preserveLineBreaks false --exec.maxBuffer 500000\n```\n\n### Node\n\n#### Import\n\n```javascript\nvar textract = require('textract');\n```\n\n#### APIs\n\nThere are several ways to extract text.  For all methods, the extracted text and an error object are passed to a callback.\n\n`error` will contain informative text about why the extraction failed. If textract does not currently extract files of the type provided, a `typeNotFound` flag will be tossed on the error object.\n\n##### File\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromFileWithPath(filePath, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromFileWithPath(filePath, config, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n##### File + mime type\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromFileWithMimeAndPath(type, filePath, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromFileWithMimeAndPath(type, filePath, config, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n##### Buffer + mime type\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromBufferWithMime(type, buffer, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromBufferWithMime(type, buffer, config, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n##### Buffer + file name/path\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromBufferWithName(name, buffer, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromBufferWithName(name, buffer, config, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n##### URL\n\nWhen passing a URL, the URL can either be a string, or a [node.js URL object](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html). Using the URL object allows fine grained control over the URL being used.\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromUrl(url, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n```javascript\ntextract.fromUrl(url, config, function( error, text ) {})\n```\n\n## Testing Notes\n\n### Running Tests on a Mac?\n- `sudo port install tesseract-chi-sim`\n- `sudo port install tesseract-eng`\n- You will also want to disable textract's usage of textutil as the tests are based on output from antiword.\n  - Go into `/lib/extractors/{doc|doc-osx|rtf}` and modify the code under `if ( os.platform() === 'darwin' ) {`. Uncommented the commented lines in these sections.\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### 2.2.0 (pending)\n* [#118](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/118).

Not stripping Microsoft dashes.\n* [#116](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/116). Better handling image binary check.\n\n### 2.1.1\n* [#111](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/111). Callback was being called two times when URL errored out.\n* [#112](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/112). PR added handling errors returned by decoding text files.\n\n### 2.1.0\n* Updated all dependencies to latest, except for [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got), which was updated, but not to the latest because of lack of support for older node versions.\n* [#93](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/93). PR added better error handling for `fromUrl` requests.\n* [#95](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/95). PR added support for monetary symbols.\n* [#96](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/96). Fixed various issues with doc handling on Windows.\n* [#97](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/97), [#102](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/102). Added ability to provide raw [node.js URL object](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html) to the `fromUrl` call which bypasses URL parsing/mangling.\n* [#98](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/98). PR shortened needlessly long file paths for temp files.\n* [#99](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/99). Now handling Chinese comma.\n* [#101](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/101). PR added UTF-8 support for antiword requests.\n* [#105](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/105). Added `tesseract.cmd` option which allows for providing an exact tesseract command-line string.\n* [#109](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/109). Properly handle RTF files with spaces in the name on OSX\n\n### 2.0.0\n* Codebase is now properly eslinted.\n* Fixed testing issue, `.csv` was `.gitignore`d preventing `.csv` test file from making into repo.\n* [#57](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/57), [#75](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/75). Added a `pdftotextOptions` in textract options. This is a proxy to the [pdf-text-extract](https://github.com/nisaacson/pdf-text-extract) options.\n* [#69](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/69). Escaping paths for all `exec` and `spawn`.\n* [#74](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/74). PR fixing fancy double quotes -> “.\n* [#77](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/77). PR fixes decoding of non-utf8 encoded files.\n* [#78](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/78). Force all mime types to lowercase for comparison.\n* [#81](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/81). Moved `.doc` (old MSWord) extraction to [antiword](http://www.winfield.demon.nl/) from catdoc. catdoc is no longer supported on OSX making it extremely difficult for me to support updates that require testing of `.doc` files.  One major difference that'll be seen with `.doc`s of certain types is [explained here](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=307657). If \"I'm afraid the text stream of this file is too small to handle.\" is an error message you see, see that post.\n* [#82](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/82), [#83](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/83). PR updated cheerio to fix a cheerio regression.\n* Fixed regression issue with above two PRs in combination. Pure `text/*` extraction left encoded characters for stylized quotes and true elipsis in the text.\n* [#88](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/88). PR fixed detection/messaging of missing binaries for `.doc`, images and `.pdf`.\n* [#89](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/89). PR returned textract to using j as a module rather than a binary.\n* [#90](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/90). PR improved content type detection when extracting from URLs. Also updated tests to pull test files using proper content-type.\n\n### 1.2.1\n* [#68](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/68). PR captured unzip errors.\n\n### 1.2.0\n* [#66](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/66). textract will no longer put the info text to stdout about the extractors not being available or installed correctly.  Instead, if you attempt to use a supported extractor that did not initialize correctly, you will get an updated error message indicating that the type is supported by textract but that external dependencies were not located. As part of this update, error messages were updated a bit to list both the type and the file.\n* [#65](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/65). Fixed issue where for `.odt` and `.docx` files with varying non-Latin characters (ex: cyrillic) were being stripped entirely of their content.\n\n### 1.1.2\n* [#63](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/63). PR added support for CSV.\n\n### 1.1.1\n* [#58](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/58)/[#59](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/59). PR fixed issue with removing line breaks when more than 1 break present.\n\n### 1.1.0\n* [#53](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/53). Cleared up documentation around CLI and line breaks.\n* [#54](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/54). PR removed `disableCatdocWordWrap` as an option, instead always disabling catdoc's word wrapping.\n* [#55](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/55). PR removed clobbering of non-boolean flags on CLI.\n\n### 1.0.4\n* [#52](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/52). PR fixed CLI post big API changes.\n\n### 1.0.3\n* [#51](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/51).  Fixed issue with large files using unzip returning blank string.\n\n### 1.0.1/1.0.2\n* [#49](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/49) Updated messages when extractors are not available to be purely informational, since textract will work just fine without some of its extractors.\n* [#50](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/50). Updated way in which catdoc was detected to not rely on file being test extracted.\n\n### 1.0.0\n* Overhaul of interface. To simplify the code, the original `textract` function was broken into `textract.fromFileWithPath` and `textract.fromFileWithMimeAndPath`.\n* [#41](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/41). Added support for pulling files from a URL.\n* [#40](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/40).  Added support for extracting text from a node `Buffer`.  This prevents you from having to write the file to disk first.  textract does have to write the file to disk itself, but because it is a textract requirement that files be on disk textract should be able to take care of that for you. Two new functions, `textract.fromBufferWithName` and `textract.fromBufferWithMime` have been added.  textract needs to either know the file name or the mime type to extract a buffer.\n* Added entity decoding, so encoded items like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`, and `&amp;` will show up appropriately in the text.\n* Removed external dependency on `unzip`\n* [#38](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/38).  Added markdown support.\n* [#31](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/31).  Added initial ODT support.  Feedback needed if there is any trouble.  Also added OTT support.\n* Added support for ODS, OTS.\n* Added support for XML, XSL.\n* Added support for POTX.\n* Added support for XLTX, XLTS.\n* Added support for ODG, OTG.\n* Added support for ODP, OTP.\n\n### 0.20.0\n* Pull Request [#39](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/pull/39) added support for not work wrapping with catdoc.\n\n### 0.19.0\n* [#30](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/30), [#34](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/34).  The command line has been improved, allowing for all the configuration options to be provided.\n\n### 0.18.0\n* [#36](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/36) Fixed error with previous deploy.\n* [#32](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/32) Fixed `docx` line break issue.\n\n### 0.17.0\n* Updated character stripping regex to be more lenient.\n\n### 0.16.0\n* Added HTML extraction.\n* Added ability for extractors to register for specific extensions (not yet used).  This handles cases where extensions (like `.webarchive`) do not have recognized mime types.\n\n### 0.15.0\n* Addressed some lingering regex issues from previous release.\n* Added tests for RTF, more tests for DOC\n* [#29](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/29) Introduced new extractor for `.doc` and `.rtf` __for OSX only__.  All non-OSX operating systems will continue to use `catdoc`. Going forward, because of issues getting `catdoc` installed on OSX, on OSX only `textutil` will be used. `textutil` comes default installed with OSX.\n\n### 0.14.0\n* [#29](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/29) which resulted in the following changes:\n1. writing info messages to `stderr` when extractors taking awhile to get going\n2. no longer removing …\n3. centralized some cleansing regexes, also no longer removing multiple back to back spaces using `\\s` as it was removing any back to back newlines.  Now scoping back to back replacing to `[\\t\\v\\u00A0]`.\n\n### 0.13.2\n* [#27](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/27), addressed issues with page ordering in `pptx` extraction.\n\n### 0.13.1\n* [#25](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/25), added language support for tesseract, see `tesseract.lang` property.\n* Updated regex that strips bad characters to not strip (some) chinese characters.  The regex will likely need updating by someonw more familiar with Chinese. =)\n\n### 0.13.0\n* [#26](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/26), using `os.tmpdir()` rather than a temp dir inside textract.\n* Upgraded to latest `j` (dependency)\n* Removed `macProcessGif` option and tests as tesseract seems to work on Mac just fine now\n\n### 0.12.0\n* [#21](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/21), [#22](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/22), Now using [j](https://www.npmjs.org/package/j) via its binaries rather than using it via node. This makes XLS/X extraction slower, but reduces memory consumption of textract signifcantly.\n\n### 0.11.2\n* Updated pdf-text-extract to latest, fixes [#20](https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/20).\n\n### 0.11.1\n* Addressed path escaping issues with tesseract, fixes [#18] (https://github.com/dbashford/textract/issues/18)\n\n### 0.11.0\n* Using [j](https://github.com/SheetJS/j) to handle `xls` and `xlsx`, this removes the requirement on the `xls2csv` binary.\n* j also supports `xlsb` and `xlsm`\n",
